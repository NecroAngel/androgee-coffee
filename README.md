#### Q: What is this?
**A:** It's a ~~Discord~~ ~~IRC~~ ~~Rcon~~ bot written in CoffeeScript

#### Q: What happened to the ~~JavaScript~~ ~~C#~~ Ruby bot?
**A:** Each language implementation had its own limitation and I am picky about requirements. CoffeeScript offers the best compromise between JavaScript and Ruby.

#### Q: What does it do?
**A:** It plugs into WebSockets & listens on Rcon endpoints and provides updates to a Discord server.

## Dependencies
While androgee-coffee is written in CofeeScript, it is setup as a node module so you don't need to install CoffeeScript to run the bot. All you need is ``nodejs`` and ``npm``. Running ``npm install`` will install all the required node_modules, including CofeeeScript itself.
